# Respawn Points (A Satisfactory Mod)

## Overview
Normally, you can only respawn at the one-and-only HUB on the map.
That can lead to long travel times when you die.
This mod adds buildings that let you respawn at the closest one.

### Mutiplayer support

✅ Full multiplayer support, including dedicated servers.


# How it works
After installing the mod, you will see a new research tree in the MAM called *Respawn Points*.

The buildings you unlock there will show up in the Builder under the category *Respawn*.

## Buildings available
There are currently two buildings available: 

The **Pod** (meant for the outside)

...and the **Chamber** (for inside factories)

More buildings are planned for future updates.

## Map markers
Each building you place will put a marker on your map, which you can then customize to your liking.

## What happens when you die?
When you die,  you will respawn at the ***closest*** Respawn Point. 
If the HUB happens to be closer, you will respawn at the HUB instead.

## What happens when you uninstall the mod?
If you uninstall the mod, all Respawn Points you have placed in the world will be deleted the next time you load the save and the standard game logic will apply on death.
